# Covid19_Xray_Detection_using_LogisticRegression

The model behaved good with **94%** accuracy. There were only 200+ images

- First converted the images into 64X64 pixels and used there rgb values to create the features of array
- Create your dataset yourself with the following command which converts the image into its path stored in file
 ```bash
  dir /b/s/w *.jpg > "filename.csv"
```
- Then create the header of whatever columns you want to add
